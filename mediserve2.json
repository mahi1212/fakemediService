		"Desc": "An Ultrasound scan uses high frequency sound waves to create pictures of soft tissues (eg. muscles, glands) and organs inside the body (eg. kidneys). The non-audible sound passing into your body is safe because it doesnâ€™t use radiation. That is why Ultrasound is often used for monitoring the growing child in pregnancy",

		"Desc": "CT stands for Computerised Tomography and can also be called a ‘CAT’ scan. CT scans are produced using specialised x-ray equipment which rotates around the body to obtain images from different angles. Modern CT scanners can take multiple slices of the body in one single rotation and as such are now referred to as Multi-Slice CT scanners. The sophisticated computer within the CT scanner is then able to process this information to create a 3-Dimensional image of the body part or area that has been scanned to show a detailed cross-section, including bones, organs and blood vessels. The CT Scan does not replace plain X-rays, but gives additional information with greater detail",
